# Lattice iCE40 HX8K VGA Project
This is a simple VGA image generator targeting the Alchitry Copper V2
board, with VGA I/Os connected according to the .pcf file.  Resistor
dividers on the R, G, B signals are used to drive at ~0.7V.

The output is a kaliedoscope-like animation with colors moving in/out
over time, and the button can be pressed to change the effect.
