# Lattice iCE40 HX8K VGA Project
This is a simple VGA image generator targeting the Alchitry Copper V2
board, with VGA I/Os connected according to the .pcf file.  Resistor
dividers on the R, G, B signals are used to drive at ~0.7V.

The image created is a moving blue checkerboard background with red and
green triangles scrolling on top - very simple and only 1-bit color depth
per channel (8 colors total).
